<h2><img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1531849430/4246/blob-sunglasses.gif?1531849430" width="30"/> Hey! Nice to meet you.</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page! </br>
Hello, I am Kwon klvna, a junior developer with the nickname "Bear." <br>
I am growing as an AI researcher through various extracurricular activities and continuous learning. <br>
My nickname comes from the recognition of those around me for silently accomplishing numerous challenging goals, both big and small. <br>

My motto is "Never give up on the task at hand and complete it to the end." <br>
This principle has earned me a reputation as a responsible person, starting from my first social experience as a non-commissioned officer and continuing through my college assignments and projects. <br>

I have a deep interest in generative AI and aim to develop AI solutions that can contribute to society.  </p>
